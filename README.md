# Some Classes that I don’t abdicate

Since I start developing for iOS, I have some singleton classes that I don’t abdicate in all my projects, because they are very useful and helpful.

The first one is the **AppEnvironment** an singleton, where I have some properties that help-me to perform some checks for the App.

The second one is the **UserSettings** an singleton, that is responsible for manage the App user settings.

Now that I have migrate the classes to swift, I have decide to share them.

Just one little advice, don’t abuse of Singleton classes, because they will compromise the application performance.
