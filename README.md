# Some Classes that I don’t abdicate

Since I start developing for iOS, I have some singleton classes that I don’t abdicate in all my projects, because they are very useful and helpful.

The first singleton is the **AppEnvironment**, where I have some properties that help-me to perform some checks for the App.

The second singleton is the **UserSettings**, that is responsible for manage the App user settings.

Now that I have migrate the classes to swift, I have decide to share them.

Just one little advice, don’t abuse of Singleton classes, because they will compromise the application performance.

# And some structs that I dont abdicate also

The first is the **AppTheme**, where I define all the necessary stuff for the user interface.

The second is the **AppSettings**, where I define all necessary constants for localization formatting and API configuration also.
